# üìÖ Important recent plug-in updates

[//]: # (We have not been sitting still and we're working on the next major release that will be labeled 1.3.19)

- ‚ö° **Key changes in hotfix version 1.3.17.15 (June 2024)**
  
  > A webhook certificate update is imminent (in effect per 1st of July).
  > **This affects websites that utilize Payment gateways through the plug-in and have webhooks set up.**
  > Read more about it in the [News & annoucnements](News-announcements.md). 
  
  If you encounter problems per that date, we have created a patch version that can be downloaded as a ZIP archive.
  This version only applies. You can install this as site administrator by replacing your existing `wp-content/plugins/bluem` plugin folder and then any webhook issues will be resolved.
  
  > **Download the new version here:** [https://github.com/bluem-development/bluem-woocommerce/releases/tag/1.3.17.15-certificate](https://github.com/bluem-development/bluem-woocommerce/releases/tag/1.3.17.15-certificate)
  
  Subsequent versions of the plug-in are compatible. As soon as we can update again, they will simply be offered the new versions automatically. So no further additional work is needed for after that.
